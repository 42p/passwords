todo:
fix .map() for IE8
add readme and todo for github
publish to amazon cdn with private URL?

Start Using!

compile code with node
save entire file to localstorage? embed scripts with base64?

v2: add scrypt support: https://github.com/cheongwy/node-scrypt-js/tree/master/lib

how hard to get from md5/sha1 hash of generated password to plaintext password?
	problem: easier because no symbols
	add symbols, length
	
how hard to get from plaintext password and domain to master password?
	problem: with plaintext password & domain run through md5 encrypt very quickly looking for matches
	solution: make comparison slower by requiring bcrypt in order to evaluate test
	
done:

don't change password destination until done generating
duckpunch validate length function instead of b64 hash function
store cost in localstorage
progress meter (over results div)
base85
add test to generator thing
remove dependencies on logging/prng/etc.
publish code to github
test in IE8, other browsers, just for kicks - works in ie8, except for progess bar
fix progress bar for IE8
make strength configurable in advanced settings (hide other settings)
