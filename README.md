Unique Passwords
================

You can use this tool to generate strong passwords for your web accounts. It internally uses the bcrypt algorithm for hashing.

## Online Version

Go to [ctrlq.org/passwords][1] to test a live version of the password generator.

How to Use
----------

1. Think of a secret passphrase - do include digits, letters and symbols and never share it with anyone.
2. Enter the account login of any website in the User Name field (case insensitive)
3. Put the website name in the domain field (case insensitive). Do not include any suffix or prefix. For instance, use google and not google.com or www.google.com.
4. Choose a password length.
5. Enter the passphrase (case insensitive) and generate your unique password for that site.

## Mobile Version

The [password generator][2] uses [responsive design][3] and therefore works across all screens including mobile phones and tablets. All it requires is a web browser with JavaScript enabled. You can also download the tool for offline use.
