Unique Passwords
================

You can use the [password generator][1] to create strong but unique passwords for all your web accounts. It internally uses the bcrypt algorithm for hashing.

How to Use
----------

Go to [ctrlq.org/passwords][1] to test a live version of the password generator.

1. Enter the account login of any website in the User Name field (case insensitive)
2. Put the website name in the domain field (case insensitive). Do not include any suffix or prefix in the domain name - for instance, use google and not google.com.
3. Choose a password length.
4. Think of a secret passphrase - do include digits, letters and symbols in your passphrase and never share it with anyone. 

Just write the passphrase (case insensitive) in the input field and hit generate to get you your unique password for that particular site.

## Mobile Version

The password generator uses [responsive design][2] and therefore works across all screens including mobile phones and tablets. All it requires is a web browser with JavaScript enabled. You can also download the tool for offline use.
